-- index.html and styles.css: 
    * index.html is our landing page, this will be the first page any user sees before logging in.
    "index.html" holds a special significance. When a user visits a website without specifying a particular page or path, 
    the web server typically looks for a file named "index.html" in the root directory of the website and displays it as the default landing page. 
    * styles.css in 'src' is the css tied with index.html
-- entry files: dealing with login/signup page
